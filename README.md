# Laminar drag & drop demo

This a demo of implementing a drag and drop functionality with [Laminar](https://laminar.dev), a [Scala.js](https://scala-js.org) frontend library.

See demo here: https://laminar-drag-drop.surge.sh/

### Dev notes

1. In one terminal run `sbt ~fastLinkJS` - this will continuously rebuild the Scala.js 
   output
2. In another terminal run `npm install` (only once) and then `npm run dev` - this will open Vite's preview server, which will automatically reload when you make any changes.
